# Limitless-Linear-Agebra-Calculator

The Limitless Linear Algebra Calculator truly is limitless! 
It create matrices of all sizes and performs a variety of operations on them, including, 
but not limited to, echelon, reduced echelon, determinant, row equivalence, rank, append, 
matrix-multiplication and matrix-addition operations. We implemented rational numbers, 
developed a library of functions to support operations on matrices and vectors, and 
created a user interface for our calculator. Our users can pick any operations they desire. 
They are then queried for the appropriate inputs before the result of that operation is printed.
